## Specification:

Design and develop a website to provide information to customers who wants to visit the shop. The goal is to allow customers to obtain an overview of the shop layout and to find details of items available from the shop. The website is not an online shopping site. The websiteâ€™s main goal is to provide information to customers who want to visit the shop in person. 

## General Requirements

The managers insist that the following requirements must be adhered to:

1. Each webpage of the website must display the logo. You can edit this image, but the font style, type and colour must remain as in the original image.

2. Do not change the proper names of the item. Do not rename the filenames of any of the images.

3. All images of each artefact must be presented to the visitor. This can be done within one webpage or distributed across several web pages. The idea is to ensure that visitors are made aware of the complete selection of items available for them to visit.

4. The images are to be used as it is. You can resize the images retaining the original aspect ratio, but do not crop or edit (e.g. recolour, touch up, sharpen, etc.) or rename the images in any way.

5. Generate a separate page providing the opening and business hours. The details are found in the shop_hours.txt file.

6. Text description for each item is not provided. You can provide your own â€˜dummyâ€™ text (i.e. lorem ipsum) to demonstrate the functionality of your web page design.
